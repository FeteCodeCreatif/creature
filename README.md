# Creature 
![](creature-mini.gif)

Customizable creature in Processing.js.

Use it with [Paysage](https://github.com/jonathanperret/paysage) for collective coding crazyness:

* Open [a random Paysage Programmer ](paysage.xyz) (and send its URL to some friends!)
* [Copy and paste the Creature code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeteCodeCreatif/creature/master/creature/creature.pde) in the editor
* Click "Go live", go full screen for more fun

Created for the **Code Creature Live Party** workshop that will take place at *Pompidou Center* during **La Fête du Code Créatif** (Creative Coding Party/Fest) on November 28th-29th 2015.

Creature is designed and programmed by Benjamin Bartholet [@telohtrab](http://twitter.com/telohtrab) in collaboration with Julien Dorra [@juliendorra](http://twitter.com/juliendorra) and Odile Fayet (Project Lead at Pompidou Center).

We welcome feedbacks, improvements, and forks ;-)
