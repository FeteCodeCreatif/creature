# Creature 
![](creature-mini.gif)

Customizable creature in Processing.js.

Use it with [Paysage](https://github.com/jonathanperret/paysage) for collective coding crazyness:

* Open [a random Paysage Programmer ](paysage.xyz) (and send its URL to some friends!)
* [Copy and paste the Creature class code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeteCodeCreatif/creature/master/creature/creature.pde) in the editor
* Add your Creature code using the [example from the leaflet](https://github.com/FeteCodeCreatif/creature/blob/master/assets/CodeCreatures_Depliant.pdf) under the "//kids code here" line. Example: *macreature.corps(atome).yeux(1).nombredebras(insecte).tailledebras(patte).main(etoile).couleurs(25);*
* Click "Go live", go full screen for more fun
* It's way more fun to play with friends, each with their own Programmer and code, send to the same Playground. But you can also send multiple Creature to the Playground. Just give it another name, and it will be a new Creature.


Created for the **Code Creature Live Party** workshop that will take place at *Pompidou Center* during **La Fête du Code Créatif** (Creative Coding Party/Fest) on November 28th-29th 2015.

Creature is designed and programmed by Benjamin Bartholet [@telohtrab](http://twitter.com/telohtrab) in collaboration with Julien Dorra [@juliendorra](http://twitter.com/juliendorra) and Odile Fayet (Project Lead at Pompidou Center).

We welcome feedbacks, improvements, and forks ;-)
